# Welcome to my Playground
This repository contains small projects of different type that Ive completed. I intended my notebooks to be easy to understand creating clear coding and transparent explanations. However, like any playground, this is the place where I want to learn, practice, test in order to improve my knowledge in data science and Machine learning. So, feel free to reach me for any tip, fix or comment.

So far:
